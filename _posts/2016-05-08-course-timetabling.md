We describe the design and implementation of a course timetabling system. Our system models the timetabling problem as a vertex coloring of a weighted graph, where each edge has a two-component weight corresponding to the two objectivesâ€”minimizing conflict and creating compact schedules. Previous work by Wehrer and Yellen (Wehrer and Yellen 2014) resulted in a Java-based system that scheduled the Rollins College Science Division in 2011. (Rickman and Yellen 2014) built upon this framework to explore new scheduling algorithms. As a part of my Student-Faculty Collaborative Research program, (2016) we have reconstructed the system to be more efficient.

`Course timetabling` for higher education institutions is a challenging
problem that requires balancing instructor and student preferences while avoiding conflicts. The underlying model for our system is a weighted graph model with two-component edge weights. The two edge-weights represent our two objectives: avoiding conflict and creating compact schedules.
